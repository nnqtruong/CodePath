# Minimum Index Sum of Two Lists: Find the common strings with the least index sum

'''
U: Understand 
    Precondition:
    - Can be empty
    - It's not null
    Constraint:
        - Pick starting index i,j such that there are the smallest possible sum
P: Plan
I: Implement

def MininumIndexSum(list1, list2) -> str:
    
    pass 

'''Example 1:
Input: list1 = ["Shogun","Tapioca Express","Burger King","KFC"], list2 = ["Piatti","The Grill at Torrey Pines","Hungry Hunter Steakhouse","Shogun"]
Output: ["Shogun"]
Explanation: The only common string is "Shogun".


Example 2:
Input: list1 = ["happy","sad","good"], list2 = ["sad","happy","good"]
Output: ["sad","happy"]
Explanation: There are three common strings:
"happy" with index sum = (0 + 1) = 1.
"sad" with index sum = (1 + 0) = 1.
"good" with index sum = (2 + 2) = 4.
The strings with the least index sum are "sad" and "happy".

Example 3:

"happy" with index sum = (0 + 1) = 1.
"sad" with index sum = (1 + 0) = 1.
"good" with index sum = (2 + 2) = 4.
